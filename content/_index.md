## About the Masterplan

The Dublin Region Energy Masterplan is a project funded by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland’s (SEAI’s) Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&D) Funding Programme 2018. Codema has been leading the project and collaborating with the four Dublin Local Authorities to establish the first regional energy masterplan in Ireland. The masterplan provides realistic, costed pathways for the Dublin Region to achieve its carbon emission reduction targets to 2030 and 2050. These pathways have been based on detailed local-level, spatially-driven energy scenario modelling and identify low-carbon technologies specific to the energy characteristics of a particular area at a local level, which has not been carried out before for any county in Ireland. To do this, the masterplan brings together and amalgamates, for the first time, all the relevant government and various energy-related departments’ plans and policies together to show their impact at a county/local level.


This masterplan focuses on the Dublin region; Dublin City, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin, and takes a holistic approach to energy modelling, which allows for better, more cost-effective solutions than looking at separate sectors in isolation. The masterplan addresses all energy sectors of electricity, heat and transport, and crucially has been modelled from a spatial perspective as well as from a technology perspective. This project also identifies and supports the use of low-carbon sources indigenous to Dublin, develops and harnesses new local-level energy policy practices, and strengthens Ireland’s integrated energy system modelling capabilities. Two baseline scenarios have been established; the current situation and the future ‘business-as-usual’ situation, which models the effects of current national level policy implementation to 2030 and 2050. From these, Codema then established the gap-to-targets, and evaluated the possible local-level low-carbon pathways to meet these targets. The low-carbon potential of Dublin has been based on its unique spatial energy characteristics, which are often overlooked when examining low-carbon pathways at a national level.

At a local level, local authorities have to meet a number of legal climate action obligations and targets, and the results
of this work have already helped and will continue to help support the DLAs to meet these obligations by taking action
on climate and meeting their policy requirements in areas such as:
- Preparation of County/City Development Plans
- Identification of Strategic Energy Zones
- Assessment of Decarbonising Zones
- Preparation of climate mitigation plans
- Roll out of low-carbon infrastructure (district heating, electric vehicle (EV) charging, etc.)
- Carbon and energy assessment of planning applications
- Creation of EU Covenant of Mayors Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans

The results of the DREM will allow local authorities to effectively create evidence-based policies and actions, which will
affect CO2 emissions county-wide, by using the local authorities’ powers in spatial planning, land-use, planning policy
and public infrastructure.
This holistic approach to analysing in-depth the local energy characteristics of the Dublin Region takes account of such
aspects as the building stock’s efficiency and energy demand, the capacities of local electricity infrastructure, land-use
constraints and availability, transport network capacities and vehicle use, and layered with expected population and
development growth. It also examines the potential for local renewable and low-carbon generation of heat, electricity
and renewable fuels in Dublin.
To define the Dublin Region’s decarbonisation pathways and help the region to meet its 2030 and 2050 targets, Codema
first had to get a good understanding of the current situation in the region; this was followed by projecting the future
business-as-usual energy demand and emissions (for the building, heat, electricity and transport sectors), followed by
the identification of low-carbon potential for the different sectors in the region. This could then all be used to determine
the net-zero pathway for Dublin.

The current spatial energy demands and emissions, which include the current energy efficiency of buildings, heat and
electricity demands and peak loads, transport demand and modal split, provided Codema with information on the
energy use and emissions from the different sectors, along with current technologies that are in use.
● Heat accounts for the majority of emissions within the Dublin region at 46%, followed by transport at 28% and
electricity at 26%.
● The sectors that have the highest impact on emissions are the residential and transport sector, which
combined, contribute around 57% to total emissions.
● Commercial buildings and services, data centres and industrial (non-ETS) buildings, account for 19%, 16% and
3% of total emissions, respectively.
● Public sector emissions - which includes all public buildings located in the Dublin Region - represents
approximately 5% of the total.
This detailed energy and emissions information was then used to give insight to the current gap for Dublin to meet its
2030 and 2050 targets. The 2030 target corresponds to a 51% reduction from 2018 figures, as defined by the
Programme for Government1
, which states that Ireland is ‘committed to an average 7% per annum reduction in overall
greenhouse gas emissions from 2018 to 2030 (a 51% reduction over the decade)’. The 2050 target is for net-zero
energy-related GHG emissions, in line with the overall target set in the Climate Action Plan 2021.
The headline figures from this masterplan show that:
● Dublin’s total energy-related emissions account for 5,969 ktCO2
● The current gap to the 2030 target amounts to approximately 2,856 ktCO2 (requiring a 48% reduction in
emissions from current levels)
● A reduction of 5,969 ktCO2 will be needed to meet the 2050 net-zero target
Based on current energy demand and emissions, Codema projected the future Business-as-Usual (BaU) scenario. This
forecast accounts for increases in population, new buildings to meet this population increase in both the housing stock
and commercial properties in future years, whilst also considering the negating effects of increased energy efficiency
in existing buildings and the rebound effect on theoretical energy demand reductions. For the increase in population,
it also assumes that the share of new car sales by fuel type would remain constant and increase to 2050. Overall,
projections to 2030 and 2050 in a BaU scenario show that emissions are expected to increase, a breakdown of this can
be seen below:
● Emission projections to 2030 will increase by 21%
● Emission projections to 2050 will increase by 33%
● Transport emissions will increase by 13% by 2050 (from 1,664 ktCO2 to 1,884 ktCO2)
● Emissions from buildings (including heat and electricity) will increase by 41% by 2050 (from 4,307 ktCO2 to
6,062 ktCO2)
The figure below shows the gap-to-target (i.e. difference between the projected business-as-usual emissions and the
target emission levels), which is represented by the dotted lines. It also outlines the technology adoption levels required
to meet these targets. The technology options are prioritised in this graph starting with the least-cost carbon reduction
option at the top and the highest cost technology option at the bottom. It should be noted that some of these
technologies should be considered in conjunction with one another and not in isolation, for example Heat Pumps and
Building Fabric Upgrades.


Key findings and recommendations that have been identified based on the pathway set out in this masterplan report
are presented below:

# Energy Planning
- Guidelines for local level energy planning need to be made available to municipalities
- Energy planning should become a requirement for implementing local-level energy plans with clear pathways
and long-term commitments to a low-carbon future
- In order to support more cost-effective and sustainable development of infrastructure (electricity grid, heat
networks, transport infrastructure, etc.) higher building density should be promoted within the county
- A GIS-based database of low-carbon technology installations within the County should be maintained. This
should include information on the size, type, grid connection details (where applicable) and energy generation
(kW peak, annual kWh) of each installation. This will allow tracking of progress toward targets and updates to
allow pathways to respond to future cost fluctuations and account for proportion of identified potential that
has been realised

# Building Energy Efficiency
- To alleviate energy poverty, the county should consider prioritising energy efficiency upgrades in areas that
have been identified in this masterplan as being energy poor. These areas include Ballybough, Cabra,
Clondalkin, Clonskeagh, Finglas, Inns Quay, Kilmore, Priorswood, Decies, Drumfinn, Inchicore, Kilmainham,
Kimmage, Kylemore, Merchants Quay Tallaght, and Wood Quay.
- Regulatory solutions to tackle the issue of split incentives should be considered, with minimum energy
efficiency standards for rented properties being applied and structures should be in place that facilitate
landlords to achieve this; this should also address funding mechanisms for energy efficiency upgrades,
particularly addressing long payback periods and high upfront costs in both the residential and non-residential
sector.
- In order to facilitate more accurate forward planning, it is recommended that a simple energy assessment
form be submitted with all planning applications. This form should include general information relating to
energy use within the development such as annual and peak demand for heat and electricity, floor area, BER,
heating system details, details of renewables on site, EV charging details, etc.

# Heat
- District heating represents the most feasible low-carbon heating option for 87% of heat demand in Dublin
by 2050 this equates to 538,983 homes and 41,394 businesses being heated by DH. Heat pumps are the most
feasible option for 13% of the heat demand in Dublin by 2050 serving 72,528 homes and 5,600 businesses.
- Heat sources that arise as a by-product of electricity generation, industrial activity, the natural environment
or from existing infrastructure are low or zero-carbon and often go to waste. Codema estimates that 3,579
MW of heat is available from these sources (including both low-grade and high-grade heat) that could be
utilised via district heat networks in Dublin, equating to 24,244 GWh of heat per annum, enough to heat
over 1.6 million homes.




Evidence-based zoning for district heating should be introduced and requirements put in place for buildings
in these areas in relation to connection, future-proofing on both the demand and supply side, characterising
heat sources (waste heat reports)
- Ensure low-carbon heat sources including waste heat are treated fairly in Part L building regulations (in line
with Articles 15 and 23 of the Renewable Energy Directive)
- Make financial support more easily available for these low-carbon solutions. Provision of up-front capital grant
funding for low-carbon heating. Make low-carbon district heating networks eligible to earn credits under the
proposed renewable heat obligation (RHO).
- Review the heat loss threshold required to secure grants for heat pumps - look at potential for increasing the
allowable heat loss index to allow more homes to be eligible for support but without exceeding limits that
would result in poor heat pump performance. The basis for such an analysis can be provided by the Irish
Building Stock Generator developed as part of this study2
.
- Introduce customer protection for district heating
- Support capacity building across the supply chain for both DH and heat pumps (planning, construction &
installation, design, finance, legal, policy and regulation, etc.)
- Support the adoption of business models in heating which support ongoing efficient and reliable
performance of heating systems by linking installer revenues to ongoing system performance
- As a high-exergy fuel, gas (including natural gas, hydrogen etc.) should not be used for low-exergy
applications like space heating and hot water preparation where more efficient and lower-carbon
alternatives exist (e.g. heat pumps, district heating). In the case of hydrogen some uncertainties remain in
relation to its viability in the short to medium term which are discussed further in Appendix C.
Electricity
- Support the development of generation assets, particularly in areas with high suitability identified in this
report. Offshore wind represents the greatest renewable electricity generating potential in the Dublin area 


with an estimated 5,241 GWh of generation by 2030 and 13,124 GWh in 2050. Utility-scale solar PV
represents the second biggest renewable electricity generating opportunity in Dublin with potential estimated
at 854 GWh in 2030 and 1,057 GWh in 2050. Onshore wind has 130 GWh of potential by 2030 and 325 GWh
by 20503
in the upland areas in the south of the county.
- Development of enabling infrastructure needs to be supported to realise renewable potential.
- Promote the adoption of building integrated PV, particularly in buildings where demand and production
profiles match. The opportunity for building integrated PV in Dublin is estimated at 84GWh in 2030 and
270GWh in 2050 which equate to the electrical demand for 19,984 and 64,394 homes respectively4
.
- For significant energy users such as data centres, ensure that these consumers take actions to reduce their
climate impacts, including:
○ Maximising on-site renewable generation and ensuring remaining demand is supplied via
renewable PPAs (preferably those which match hourly site demand), which finance renewable
electricity projects within Ireland or its territorial waters
○ Ensure that any waste heat produced on site is characterised and made available for use in existing
or planned DH networks - this reduces onsite electricity and water consumption for cooling systems
and can make use of waste heat from on-site generators which may be needed to support the grid in
high demand periods
○ Ensuring that data centre and other large electricity consumers impact on the grid is minimised. This
will be assessed by relevant parties such as EirGrid in accordance with Data Centre grid connection
processing procedure to ensure that grid integrity is maintained. Connection to district heating
networks can also reduce the electricity demand associated with cooling data centres and in heating
the buildings connected to the network when compared with individual heat pumps
Transport
● Cars account for 65% of transport emissions in Dublin and may be costing the county up to €2.8 billion per
year in external societal costs. Simply aiming to replace the existing 550,000 cars in Dublin with EVs would
represent a huge missed opportunity to create a healthier, safer and more equitable transport system and
society. Reducing car dependency and enabling a shift to active travel and public transport needs to be the
number one priority, followed by the electrification of a reduced car fleet.
● Active travel is the simplest, quickest and most cost-effective way to decarbonise urban mobility, particularly
for shorter journeys. E-bikes can significantly increase the range over which active travel is possible, and are
now the fastest growing form of electric mobility in Europe.5 Dublin is a highly urbanised county, with huge
potential for active travel if the appropriate policies are implemented.
● The Government’s Five Cities Demand Management Study, published in 2021, identified the ‘15 Minute
Neighbourhoods’ concept as the number one measure that should be prioritised in order to address the
carbon emissions, congestion and air quality issues in Dublin. To help enable this, City and County
Development Plans should consider adopting a strict limit on the distance between new developments and
regularly used amenities (e.g. shops, schools etc.) with good permeability for active and public transport
between both. A default 30 km/h limit should be designated in built up areas of the County, with exceptions
for specific roads, as required by the UN Stockholm Declaration of 2020.
● Transport policy to 2030 must focus on improving active travel and bus infrastructure and services, in order
to enable the significant modal shift required towards these more sustainable modes. The planned new Metro
and Luas projects are extremely expensive in comparison, and none of these will be completed in time to assist
towards our 2030 targets.
● Additional powers are required to allow local authorities to reallocate public space to more sustainable
modes and to implement low-traffic neighbourhoods or filtered permeability schemes. Reallocating public
space away from motor traffic can also provide additional safe space for nature, for people to socialise and for 


children to play. Legislation to provide for experimental road traffic orders, allowing for trials of 6-18 months,
should be enacted.
● The spending of billions of Euro on bus corridors and active travel infrastructure will have been in vain if
existing road traffic regulations are not enforced. Traffic wardens, fixed cameras and bus-mounted cameras
using ANPR technology must be employed on a large scale to detect and fine motorists who create danger or
delays to active travel and public transport users. A web portal allowing members of the public to upload
footage of dangerous and/or illegal road user behaviour to An Garda Síochána must also be developed
without delay.
● Remote working and high-speed broadband may enable significant reductions in transport demand and
emissions by reducing the distance and number of commuting journeys. However, further analysis is required
to compare this reduction in transport emissions against the corresponding increase in domestic heating
demands. The development of co-working hubs and accelerated rollout of high-speed broadband throughout
the county may provide a good balance in this regard, and should be supported and prioritised.
● Electrification of transport is necessary but not sufficient to meet our energy and emissions targets. If the
2030 EV sales targets set out in the CAP 2019 (scaled proportionately to Dublin) are met, this could reduce CO2
emissions from transport in Dublin by at best 33%. This in itself will be a very challenging target to meet. The
pathway taken in this analysis to achieve a 51% reduction by 2030 will additionally require a minimum 23%
reduction in the distance travelled by fossil-fuelled cars in Dublin.
● EV charging infrastructure needs to be provided in a manner which does not prioritise private motor vehicles
over active travel or public transport users and which will facilitate a significant shift away from car use. Up
to 4,600 rapid (50-150 kW) charge points may be required by 2030 to meet the demands of 213,000 BEVs.
Socio-Economic
Codema has recommended ways to reduce emissions in the county. If the Dublin Region were to carry out all the
suggested recommendations, it could potentially:
● Reduce emissions by 4,103 ktCO2 by the year 2030
● Reduce emissions by 8,240 ktCO2 by 2050
● Increase renewable electricity generation in the Dublin Region by 14,780 GWh by 2050.
● Become a net-exporter of energy by 2050 - it is assumed that these exports offset more carbon intensive
generation elsewhere in the country and therefore allow Dublin’s energy system to become carbon negative
in 2050 (-295 ktCO2)
● Decrease electricity production costs by a total of €519 million per year by adopting renewable energy
technologies (onshore and offshore wind, utility scale solar PV and building integrated solar PV)
● The net zero scenario will result in €24 billion less in external societal costs than the BAU scenario when
accounting for the shadow price of carbon (and as shadow price of carbon is likely to be revised upwards, this
figure could increase)
● Increase direct jobs by over 182,500 by 2050
